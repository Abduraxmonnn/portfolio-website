I collaborate with frontend teams to ensure API functionality aligns with user interface requirements. My experience includes utilizing PostgreSQL as the database management system, employing Git for version control, and managing project tasks with tools like Jira. Additionally, I've optimized API performance through database query optimization and caching mechanisms. Further expanding my skillset, I independently learned front-end development principles using React. This newfound knowledge allowed me to develop a new admin interface for our internal systems, improving user experience and streamlining workflows. For the FiscalBox payment system, I also integrated with various financial services and wrote clear API documentation."
